The following ActionScript 3 code attempts to access a property of an object that may not exist, leading to an undefined property error.  This often happens when dealing with data from external sources (e.g., XML, JSON) where the structure isn't guaranteed.

```actionscript
// Example data that might be missing 'address'
var myData:Object = {name:"John Doe", age:30};

// Attempting to access address without checking if it exists
var address:String = myData.address;
trace(address); // Throws an error if address is undefined
```
